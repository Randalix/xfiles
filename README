                                 xfiles

This is a still incomplete file manager for X11.  It can only navigate
through directories, select files (and do nothing with them), call a
script to open files, and call a script to produce and cache thumbnails.

(0) Edit config.mk to your system configuration.

(1) First copy the scripts ./thumbnail to your $PATH (or write their
    complete path in the following step).

(2) Edit ./config.h, especially the four first items.  Set the `opener`
    field of the `config` structure to the name of the opener script (or
    to its complete path).  Set `thumbnailer` to the thumbnailer script.
    Set `dirthumb_path` to the path to `folder.png`.  And finally, set
    `filethumb_path` to the path to `file.png`.

(3) Run make.

(4) Run ./xfiles, you can give it the path to any directory as argument.

(5) ???

(6) Enjoy.
