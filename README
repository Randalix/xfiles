                                 xfiles

This is a still incomplete file manager for X11.  It can only navigate
through directories, select files (and do nothing with them), call a
script to open files, and call a script to generate thumbnails.

To run xfiles, do the following:
• (1) First copy the script ./thumbnail to your $PATH.
• (2) Run make.
• (3) Run ./xfiles, you can give it the path to any directory as argument.

§ Dependencies

The thumbnail script depends on ImageMagick to generate thumbnails.  It
also depends on the following programs:
• ffmpegthumbnail(1): to generate thumbnail for videos. 
• rsvg-convert(1): to generate thumbnail for svg files. 
• pdftoppm(1): to generate thumbnail for pdf. 
• ffmpeg(1): to generate thumbnail for audio files. 

§ Customization

You can edit ./config.h, to customize your build at compile time.
You can also set some environment variables and X resources to customize
XFiles at runtime.

You can set the `opener` field of the `config` structure (in the
`config.h` file) to the name of the opener script (or its complete
path).  Set `thumbnailer` to the thumbnailer script.  You can also
set the environment variables `OPENER` and `THUMBNAILER` to the names
(or absolute paths) of those programs.

You can set `dirthumb_path` to the path a png image of a folder icon
(this should be provided by your icon theme); and set `filethumb_path`
to the path of a file icon.  If these are not provided, xfiles will use
the icons provided at compilation time by the files `file.xpm` and
`folder.xpm`.

§ TODO.

• Implement copy and move operations.
• Implement CLI commands.
• Implement right-click context menu.
• Implement drag-and-drop.
• Use kqueue/inotify to check for directory changes.
